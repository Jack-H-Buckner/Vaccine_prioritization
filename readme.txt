This project contains code to run the analysis found in "Dynamic Prioritization of 
COVID-19 Vaccines When Social Distancing is Limited for Essential Workers." 

The project is organized into eight folders: 

data_inputs - data used to generate model parameters (e.g. contact matrices)
data_transformed - transformed contact matrices and other parameters
code_transforms - code that produces transformed contact rates
code_model - code that defines the model
	dynamics - files that simulate SEIR model
	optimization - files that define optimization algorithm
	parameters - organizes parameters for model runs
	tests 
model_runs - files that define model runs 
data_outputs - data output by model runs 
code_figures - analyzes data outputs
figures - figures from analysis 
legacy - old code
